# Course Project 1

This is my repo for Exploratory Data analysis Course Project 1. I have 8 files, 4 png and 4 R scripts. In order to run these scripts you will need to download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
After your data and the scripts are downloaded intoyour working directory, you may then run the scripts to generate the png plot files.
